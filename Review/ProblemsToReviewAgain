1. Array

2. Two Pointers

3. Stack
- For stack problems, you can always append information to the top element like minimum_value_up_to_that_element

4. Binary Search
- Trick to turn 2d coordinates into 1d and vice versa.
- For problems that ask you to find the minimum, maximum value, you should always try to see whether you can use
  binary search or not.
- Algorithm to find the kth smallest number among 2 sorted arrays.

5. Sliding Window

- If you need to find the maximum / minimum value when using sliding window, it is probably a good idea to use
  monostack.

6. Linked list

- Proof of the turtle vs rabbit algorithm

7. Trees
- Proof for finding diameter of a binary tree.
- Technique to generate id for
- Binary jumping (if you have time)

8. Backtracking

9. 1D DP

10. 2D DP

11. Bit Manipulation

12. Math and geometry

13. Tries

14. Heap

15. Intervals

16. Greedy

17. Graph
- For graph problems that ask you to find the minimum distance from some cells to some other cells that satisfy some conditions => BFS simultaneously

18. Advanced graph
- If the problems ask you to find the order of something, there is a huge chance you gonna need Topo Sort.
