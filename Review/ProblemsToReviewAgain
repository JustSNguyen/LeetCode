1. Array
   Valid Anagram

2. Two Pointers
   Trapping Rain Water

3. Stack
   Generate Parentheses
   Car Fleet

- For stack problems, you can always append information to the top element like minimum_value_up_to_that_element

4. Binary Search
   Search a 2D matrix
   Median of 2 sorted arrays
   Search in a rotated sorted array
   Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

- Trick to turn 2d coordinates into 1d and vice versa.
- For problems that ask you to find the minimum, maximum value, you should always try to see whether you can use
  binary search or not.
- Algorithm to find the kth smallest number among 2 sorted arrays.

5. Sliding Window

- If you need to find the maximum / minimum value when using sliding window, it is probably a good idea to use
  monostack.

6. Linked list
   Remove nth node from end of list.
   Copy list with random pointers (trick to append copied node right next to the current node)
   Reverse nodes in K group
   Find The Duplicate Number

- Proof of the turtle vs rabbit algorithm

7. Trees
   Diameter of a binary tree
   Subtree of another tree
   Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
   Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

- Proof for finding diameter of a binary tree.
- Technique to generate id for
- Binary jumping (if you have time)

8. Backtracking
   Subsets II
   Combination Sum
   Combination Sum II
   Palindrome Partitioning

9. 1D DP

10. 2D DP

11. Bit Manipulation
    Reverse Bits

12. Math and geometry
    Rotate Image
    Detect squares
    Detect squares (hard version)

13. Tries
    Word Search II

14. Heap
    Design Twitter
    Find Median From data stream

15. Intervals
    Minimum intervals to include each query
    Meeting rooms 2

16. Greedy
    Valid parenthesis string
    Jump game 2
    Gas station (Proof if have time)

17. Graph
    Topo sort
    Word ladder
    Surrounded regions
    Pacific water flow
    Number of connected components in a directed graph

- For graph problems that ask you to find the minimum distance from some cells to some other cells that satisfy some conditions => BFS simultaneously

18. Advanced graph

Min Cost to Connect All Points (Prim)
Network Delay Time (Dijkstra)
Cheapest Flights Within K Stops (Bellman Fords)
Swim in rising water
Reconstruct Itinerary (Eulerian path)
Review Hamilton path

- If the problems ask you to find the order of something, there is a huge chance you gonna need Topo Sort.
