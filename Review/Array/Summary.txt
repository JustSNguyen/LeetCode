- For problems that require you to find the minimum, maximum value of a subarray, subsequence after updating the tail or start
of that subarray, subsequence, there is a huge chance you gonna need MONOSTACK.

- In problems where you need to find the max dp in a certain range, try to use MONOSTACK.

- Exactly K times = at most K times - at most K - 1 times

- For array problems, Two pointers first then DP

- For problems that require you to count the number of subarrays that satisfy some conditions, you can try to
use prefix sum if possible.

- For problems that require you to find the min, max length of something, you DON'T need to find the min, max length
at every index. For example, if you know that the current minimum length is 3 then you only need to consider
all subarrays with length <= 3 even if there is a subarray with length > 3 that satisfies the condition, it does
not matter since the min length is still the same.

- For problems that are related to frequency, you can try to utilize bucket sort (time complexity: O(N))
