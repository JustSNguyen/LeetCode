+ 684

- NOTES:
+ For queue, list, ..., you should always check whether they are empty or not before indexing
+ READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY
+ divide and take the remainder
+ For graph problems, you also need to ask for the number of edges.
+ For topology sort, you should check whether you can visit all the nodes after completing the dfs
