1. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes:
+ For subarray problems, sliding window is a very powerful technique 
+ You can combine sliding window and monotonic queue to get the minimum value and maximum value of the current window.

2. Constrained Subsequence Sum
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes: 
+ For subsequence problems, you should think of dp 
+ Monotonic queue is very useful in situation where you need to get the maximum value in a specific range

3. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 
Notes:
+ For problems that ask you to find subarrays that satisfy some conditions, you should try to think about how you
can find the longest / shortest / largest / smallest subarray that ends at index i and satisfy the conditions.

4. Replace the Substring for Balanced String
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 

5. Count Number of Nice Subarrays 
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
NOTES:
+ Exactly K = At most K - At most (K - 1)
+ For problems where you might need to store both the longest and shortest subarrays that satisfy some conditions
and end at index j, it is a good idea to use 3 pointers.

6. Max Consecutive Ones III

9. Fruit Into Baskets 
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/description/
DO AGAIN: NO

10. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 

11. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/description/
DO AGAIN: YES

12. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/description/
DO AGAIN: YES
NOTES:
- In range problems, you need to be careful of edge case where the answer starts from index 0
- Monotonic queue can be utilized from both the start index and the last index.
- For problem where you need to find the minimum length / maximum length, you don't need to find the minimum
length or maximum length for each index. So for example, if you know the minimum substring that satisfies
the condition ends at index j has length 3, then if you can not find any substrings with length < 3 that ends
at index j + 1 then you can just ignore index j + 1 if the question only asks for minimum length.

13. Sum of Subarray Minimums

DO AGAIN: NO

14. Online Stock Span
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/
DO AGAIN: NO

15. Score of Parentheses
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-parentheses/description/
DO AGAIN: YES
Note:
- Trick to save the number of layers inside each bracket by pushing it back to the stack.

16. Next Greater Element II
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/description/
DO AGAIN: NO
Note:
- Trick to save indexes and double the array when dealing with circular array.

17. Next Greater Element I
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/
DO AGAIN: NO

18.Trapping Rain Water
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/
DO AGAIN: YES

19. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/
DO AGAIN: YES
Notes:
- You can also try the approach where you need to find maximum subarray with the condition that the minimum
/maximum value of that subarray equals to value[i]

19. 3 SUM 
DO AGAIN: YES 
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/

20. Top K Frequent Elements 
DO AGAIN: YES 
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/ 
NOTES:
- In problems related to frequency, you can try the approach of spliting the array based on the frequency. 

21. Valid Sudoku
DO AGAIN: YES
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/
Notes:
- In problems where the range of value for each element is small, try bitset
- Trick to set ith bit to 1
- Trick to set ith bit to 0
- Trick to identify the corresponding square based on row and column in sudoku board.

21. Encode and decode strings

22. Valid Parentheses
DO AGAIN: YES
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/

23. Min stack
Do again: No
https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/
Notes:
For stack problem where you need to retrieve some information from the stack in O(1), you can try to append some information to each
element before pushing it to the stack.

24. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
Do again: No
https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/description/
