1. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes:
+ For subarray problems, sliding window is a very powerful technique 
+ You can combine sliding window and monotonic queue to get the minimum value and maximum value of the current window.


2. Constrained Subsequence Sum
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes: 
+ For subsequence problems, you should think of dp 
+ Monotonic queue is very useful in situation where you need to get the maximum value in a specific range

3. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 
Notes:
+ For problems that ask you to find subarrays that satisfy some conditions, you should try to think about how you
can find the longest / shortest / largest / smallest subarray that ends at index i and satisfy the conditions.

4. Replace the Substring for Balanced String
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 

5. Count Number of Nice Subarrays 
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
NOTES:
+ Exactly K = At most K - At most (K - 1)
+ For problems where you might need to store both the longest and shortest subarrays that satisfy some conditions
and end at index j, it is a good idea to use 3 pointers.

6. Max Consecutive Ones III

DO AGAIN: NO 

7. Binary Subarrays With Sum

DO AGAIN: NO 

8. Subarrays with K Different Integers
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 

9. Fruit Into Baskets 
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/description/
DO AGAIN: NO

10. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 

11. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/description/
DO AGAIN: YES

12. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/description/
DO AGAIN: YES
NOTES:
- In range problems, you need to be careful of edge case where the answer starts from index 0
- Monotonic queue can be utilized from both the start index and the last index.
- For problem where you need to find the minimum length / maximum length, you don't need to find the minimum
length or maximum length for each index. So for example, if you know the minimum substring that satisfies
the condition ends at index j has length 3, then if you can not find any substrings with length < 3 that ends
at index j + 1 then you can just ignore index j + 1 if the question only asks for minimum length.
