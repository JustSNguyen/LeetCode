1. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes:
+ For subarray problems, sliding window is a very powerful technique 
+ You can combine sliding window and monotonic queue to get the minimum value and maximum value of the current window.


2. Constrained Subsequence Sum
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes: 
+ For subsequence problems, you should think of dp 
+ Monotonic queue is very useful in situation where you need to get the maximum value in a specific range

3. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 
Notes:
+ For problems that ask you to find subarrays that satisfy some conditions, you should try to think about how you
can find the longest / shortest / largest / smallest subarray that ends at index i and satisfy the conditions.

4. Replace the Substring for Balanced String
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 

5. Count Number of Nice Subarrays 
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
NOTES:
+ Exactly K = At most K - At most (K - 1)
+ For problems where you might need to store both the longest and shortest subarrays that satisfy some conditions
and end at index j, it is a good idea to use 3 pointers.

6. Max Consecutive Ones III
