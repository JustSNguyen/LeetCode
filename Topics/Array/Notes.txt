1. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes:
+ For subarray problems, sliding window is a very powerful technique 
+ You can combine sliding window and monotonic queue to get the minimum value and maximum value of the current window.


2. Constrained Subsequence Sum
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/description/
DO AGAIN: YES 
Notes: 
+ For subsequence problems, you should think of dp 
+ Monotonic queue is very useful in situation where you need to get the maximum value in a specific range

3. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/description/
DO AGAIN: NO 
Notes:
+ For problems that ask you to find subarrays that satisfy some conditions, you should try to think about how you
can find the longest / shortest / largest / smallest subarray that ends at index i and satisfy the conditions.

4. Replace the Substring for Balanced String
