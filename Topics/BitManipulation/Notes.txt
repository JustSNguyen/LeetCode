1. Single Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/
Do again: Yes
Notes:
- a xor a = 0
- a xor b xor c xor d = (a xor c) xor (b xor d)

2. Number of 1 Bits
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/
Do again: No
Notes:
- n & (n - 1) trick to calculate number of 1 bit in a number.

3. Counting Bits
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/description/
Do again: No
Notes: - Number of one bits in N equals to 1 + number of one bits in M with M = N - largest power of two smaller than N

4. Reverse Bits
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/
Do again: Yes
Notes:
- Trick to reverse a binary string without using for loop / while loop

5. Missing Number
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/
Do again: Yes
Notes:
- For problems where you need to find ONE missing number that satisfies some conditions, you can try to utilize the xor trick.
(a xor a = 0, 0 xor a = a)

6. Sum of Two Integers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/description/
Do again: Yes
Notes:
- Techniques to add and minus two numbers using bit manipulation

7. Operations using bits only (REVIEW)
- Add: Like Leetcode Sum of Two Integers
- Minus: Minus is just add with negative numbers
- Multiply: a *= 2, b //= 2
- Divide: Find the largest power of two p such that p * divisor <= dividend
- Modulus

8. Reverse Integer
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/
Do again: Yes
Notes:
- Trick to reverse a negative number without converting it to positive number first.
- math.trunc trick
