1. Problem 45 (DO AGAIN)

2. Problem 134 (DO AGAIN AND PROOF)

3.  Problem 678 (do again using O(1) space). For parentheses problem, it is good to use the idea of
diff = number of open bracket - number of close bracket.

For normal problem (with only open and close bracket), at any moment diff < 0 => false, at the end if diff > 0 => false else true
For this problem diff is a range from min_diff to max_diff
min_diff is when we decide to replace all * with close bracket
max_diff is when we decide to replace all * with open bracket
