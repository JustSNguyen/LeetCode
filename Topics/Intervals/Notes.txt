1. Problem 57
DO AGAIN: YES
- Be careful of case when the list is empty

2. Problem 56
- For intervals problem, you should check whether the list of intervals is sorted or not. If not, then you should try to sort it.

3. Problem 435
- Do again using DP Solution
- For interval problems that require you to remove minimum number of intervals to make the intervals list non overlapped, a greedy
approach would be sort by interval[1] and then try to pick all interval with minimum end.

4. Meeting room 2
- Do again

5. Minimum interval to include each query 
- For NlogN time complexity, there is a really huge chance you gonna need a heap 
- The trick in this problem is to realize that if an interval is invalid for a smaller query, it will also
be invalid for a larger query. 
- Do again: Yes
